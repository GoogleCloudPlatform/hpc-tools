# This script is for the startup firstrun to configure software environment.
# It reads metadata from its compute engine metadata server and conducts the
# following operations:
# - MPI environment set up: use google_install_mpi to install MPI software
# - MPI tuning set up: use google_mpi_tuning to apply system tunings for getting
#  better performance for MPI application.
